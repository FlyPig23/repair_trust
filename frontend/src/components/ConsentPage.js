            <h1>Research Study Consent Form</h1>
            <p>We invite you to participate in a research study being conducted by investigators from Washington
                University in St. Louis. You are being asked to participate in this research study because you
                are an English-speaking adult in the United States. The aim of this research is to explore the
                effectiveness of trust repair strategies used in artificial intelligence (AI) systems,
                particularly in the context of data visualizations. We seek to understand how these strategies
                can influence your trust in summaries generated by AI about various data visualizations. This
                study will investigate whether these repair policies can maintain or restore trust after it has
                been challenged by inaccuracies in AI-generated content. <br/>
                If you agree to participate, you will first complete a brief demographic survey. Then we would
                like you to interpret a series of data visualization. You will be engaged in the analysis of
                these visualizations. For each iteration, a data visualization paired with an AI-generated response
                will be provided as a point of reference. Your task involves evaluating the AI's response and
                deciding whether to adopt it as is, modify it, or craft an entirely new response. You must also
                rate the reliability, accuracy, and trustworthiness of the AI response. You cannot proceed to
                the next item until you have completed the current one. Following the completion of 15
                analysis-based questions, the survey will transition to multiple-choice questions. For each
                question, you will see a new data visualization and a problem to solve. Choose the BEST answer to
                the questions. If you are unsure, Select ''Skip'' instead of guessing. You are also free to skip
                any questions that you prefer not to answer. <br/>
                We would like to use the data we are obtaining in this study for studies going on right now as
                well as studies that are conducted in the future. These studies may provide additional
                information that will be helpful in developing better visual communication tools and
                contributing to making AI technologies more reliable and trustworthy. <br/>
                It is unlikely that what we learn from these studies will have a direct benefit to you. There
                are no plans to provide financial compensation to you should this occur. By allowing us to use
                your data you give up any property rights you may have in the data. We will share your data with
                other researchers. They may be doing research in areas similar to this research or in other
                unrelated areas. These researchers may be at Washington University, at other research centers
                and institutions, or industry sponsors of research. We may also share your research data with
                large data repositories (a repository is a database of information) for broad sharing with
                the research community. If your individual research data is placed in one of these repositories
                only qualified researchers, who have received prior approval from individuals that monitor the
                use of the data, will be able to look at your information. <br/>
                Your data will be stored without your name or any other kind of link that would enable us to
                identify which data are yours. Therefore, it will be available indefinitely for use in future
                research studies without your additional consent and cannot be removed. <br/>
                There are no known risks from being in this study. <br/>
                You will not benefit personally. However, we hope that others may benefit in the future from
                what we learn as a result of this study. <br/>
                You will not have any costs for being in this research study. <br/>
                You will be paid for being in this research study. You will receive a pay of $8 for completing
                this quiz. At the end of the study, copy your survey code back to Prolific to receive your
                payment. We will keep the information you provide confidentially. This survey is completely
                anonymous; we will not collect any personally identifiable information. We will only have access
                to your Prolific ID only, which we will use solely for payment purposes. <br/>
                Any report or article that we write will not include information that can directly identify you.
                The journals that publish these reports or articles require that we share the information that
                was collected for this study with others to make sure the results of this study are correct and
                help develop new ideas for research. Your information will be shared in a way that cannot
                directly identify you. <br/>
                Federal regulatory agencies and Washington University, including the Washington University
                Institutional Review Board (a committee that reviews and approves research studies) and the
                Human Research Protection Office, may inspect and copy records pertaining to this research. Your
                participation in this study is completely voluntary. You may choose not to take part at all.
                If you decide to participate in the study, you may stop participating at any time. Any data that
                was collected as part of this study will remain as part of the study records and cannot be
                removed. If you decide not to take part in the study or if you stop participating at any time,
                you wonâ€™t be penalized or lose any benefits for which you otherwise qualify. If you do not wish
                to participate in this study or want to end your participation in the study, close the browser
                tab without answering any of the questions. <br/>
                We encourage you to ask questions. If you have any questions about the research study itself,
                please contact Hangxiao Zhu (hangxiao@wustl.edu). If you feel you have been harmed from being in
