            <h2>Welcome and Thank You for Participating in Our Research Study!</h2>
            <p>
                In this study, you will be playing the role of a journalist at a major national newspaper tasked with
                writing summary descriptions for data visualizations that will be included in upcoming articles. <br/>
                We have provided AI-generate summaries to aid this process. You can choose to use of AI summaries or
                edit them. You will be asked to give feedback on the AIâ€™s performance with each visualization. <br/>
                You will repeat this process for a total of <strong>15 visualizations</strong>, with a short optional
                break between each set of 5.  <br/>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will be given 15 data visualizations, in 3 batches of 5 visualizations each.</li>
                <li>At the beginning, you will be asked to rate your initial trust level in the AI system's ability.
                </li>
                <li>After each batch, you will be asked to rate your trust level in the AI system's ability based on
                    your experience with the AI system.
                </li>
                <li>Each turn will require you to analyze the visualization, then evaluate an AI generated response.
                </li>
                <li>After evaluating the AI response, you can rate your trust in the AI system's ability
                    based on the response.
                </li>
                <li>You also have the option to determine whether you would use the AI system's response, or edit it
                    before using it, or write a completely new response.
                </li>
                <li>Write no more than 3 sentences for each response if you choose to write your own.</li>
                <li>Answer to the best of your ability. You cannot skip questions.</li>
