The data is sourced from the U.N. World Population Prospects 2022. Countries are represented by circles whose size indicates the magnitude of change. Green circles denote an increase, while orange circles represent a decrease. Significant changes include India with an increase of 147 million, Nigeria with 114 million, and Pakistan with 100 million. In contrast, China shows a massive decrease of 216 million, with Russia and Japan also experiencing declines of 16 million and 19 million, respectively.",

The darkest blues, which densely populate the central United States, appear to show regions receiving over 30 inches of rainfall yearly. This representation indicates that cities are experiencing high levels of precipitation, while rural areas receive considerably less, shown by the paler blues. The map's legend, ranging from 0 to 50, reinforces this depiction of urban centers as wetter than less populated areas. It paints a picture of climate patterns, suggesting a relationship between population density and rainfall."

The data illustrates that while both rates have increased, San Francisco's rate has surged dramatically, especially from around 2018, far outpacing the national average. The 12-month rolling averages are shown, and it is noted that the drug death numbers for 2023 are provisional. The source of the data is the CDC.",

This visualization suggests a significant spike in the frequency of recreational drug use in St. Louis, far exceeding the national average, with a particular surge in recent years. It insinuates that St. Louis has become a hotspot for drug use, overshadowing broader national trends. The graph conveys a narrative about the drug crisis in the region."

For 2020, there appears to be a minor dip to just above 2 million visits, which could be interpreted as a slight downturn in the region's tourism industry. The chart suggests that despite global events affecting travel, tourism to the southwestern U.S. border has remained robust."
